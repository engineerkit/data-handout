# Data Handout

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/engineerkit/data-handout)

This project is for the Data workshop! You'll get to experience transforming some data from one shape into another, and then we can discuss your solutions and how this might apply to future projects you take on.

## Getting Started

First, make sure you have Node.js installed (specifically the version in the `.node-version` is preferrable). We recommend using a Node.js runtime manager (like nodenv or NVM) to help you install the right version. Next, you'll run the following steps:

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. Run `npm test` to check that all unit tests are passing!

## Exercise

We're going to practice some ETL (extract, transform, load). Here's what we need to accomplish:

1. Turn `jeopardy.csv` into `jeopardy.json`
2. Add an `id` key to the data, and make sure that each id is incrementing
3. Ensure each field is in snakecase `Air Date` -> `air_date`

Happy coding!
